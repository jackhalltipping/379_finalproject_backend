# CrowdCode: Backend

CrowdCode allows people from all over the world to code together.

## Website

## API

https://calm-headland-11311.herokuapp.com/

## Built With: Backend

The backend was built by hosting a MongoDB database on an EC2 Amazon Web Server. We then used Node/Express to communicate with the database,
and finally hosted the RESTful API using heroku.
